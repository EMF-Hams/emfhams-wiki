==Things to during EMF==
===Radio Village Workshops/Talks===
We plan on running some small talks/workshops on a fairly informal basis, these will include: 
* Introduction to software defined radio - Dominic
* Something TBD - Paul
* Amateur Radio: The Original Nerd Hobby - Ryan Sayre (2E0RYS / KG7NMC)
* <span style="color: red;">YOUR_TALK_HERE</span>

===Contests===
During EMF the following contests will be running

===Special Event Station===
Paul (M0OKE) has applied for an NoV for a special call sign for a special event station, '''[[GB2EMF]]'''.  

This has been granted.

Colin (G8TMV) has organised RSGB posters and info leaflets.

===Talk In===

Talk in will be happening on 2m on Friday and will possibly continue intermittently throughout the weekend.  Operator(s) required.  This will take place on 145.550 MHz.

===Modes & Bands===

Steve M0SPN intends to run voice on HF.  VHF/UHF dependent on availability of masts and beams.

Iain MM6MVQ will have an SSTV receiving station operating during EMF on 70cm that will upload recieved images to the Internet. For details on this, see the [[Villages:57North#SSTV_Receiving_Station|57North village]] page.

==Local Stuff==

===Clubs===
* Milton Keynes ARS (MKARS) are literally just up the road from the campsite - http://www.mkars.org.uk/ 

===Repeaters===
It would be very cool to have a dedicated on-site repeater just for EMF.  The practicality wouldn't be too difficult -- M0RND can provide a 2m/70cm colinear (which might be able to be hosted on the main EMF mast), and there's no shortage of radios which can do cross-band repeat, or something could be lashed up with two Baofeng UV-B5 radios and a diplexer.

The awkward part would be getting an NoV for the repeater, and getting it in time for EMF.

==Amateur Radio Village Feedback==

===What Went Well===
* The tent was friendly and there were a lot of interested people dropping in and exchanging knowledge. [[User:Irl|Irl]] ([[User talk:Irl|talk]]) 19:26, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

===What Didn't===
* No one sent any SSTV to my recieving station. That probably could have been planned a lot better. [[User:Irl|Irl]] ([[User talk:Irl|talk]]) 19:26, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

===Ideas for 2016===
* Get the whole camp mapped out using APRS. i.e. where the villages are, etc.
** Get all the Hams on site with portable APRS setup
** We're looking at a cheap [http://foxdelta.com/products/foxtrak1.htm FOXTRAK :: APRS Tracker] setup
* Throw some packets at the ISS / other amateur satellite things
* Foundation/intermediate practical workshops
* EME?
* Computer Logging (maybe adding to CloudLog online logbook see [here http://logbook.m3php.com/2e0sql/])
* Website/Blog
