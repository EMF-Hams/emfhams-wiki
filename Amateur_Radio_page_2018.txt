==Amateur Radio==
Quoting from Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio Amateur Radio page] ''"Amateur radio (also called "ham" radio) describes the use of radio frequency spectra for purposes of non-commercial exchange of messages, wireless experimentation, self-training, private recreation and emergency communication".''

During EMF 2018 will shall be showcasing Amateur Radio on Bands from 3.5 MHz (80m) to 430MHz (70cm) and maybe higher. We'll also have a local frequency on either 144MHz (2m) &/or 430MHz (70cm) FM.

For reference, the EMF site in Eastnor is at Gridsquare: IO82ta. WAB Square: SO73

Unique Hackerspace passport stamp available on site. Please ask for Paul M0TZO for the stamp in your passport.

==Station Planning==
Initial plan made from comments/equipment above.  Please keep updated with offers/changes.

Bear in mind that this is an initial framework based on the offers of equipment received and the constraints of the site as best we can determine from Google/OS etc. It's quite likely to change on the day so please don't be surprised if you've offered equipment to do one thing but we suggest it's better for something else.  If you have particular plans please raise it in the IRC channel.

Do we want a dedicated base station doing V/UHF Voice?
